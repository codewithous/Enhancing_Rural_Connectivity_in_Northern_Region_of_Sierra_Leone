## Enhancing Rural Connectivity in Northern Region of Sierra Leone: Investigating Strategies to Improve Rural Connectivity and Mobile Services

>> The issue of the rural-urban divide in mobile network coverage and connectivity remains a significant challenge, despite the advancements in mobile network technologies. While urban areas, particularly the metropolitan regions, have seen improvements in mobile service delivery through the deployment of small base stations with enhanced computing capabilities, rural communities continue to lag behind. The rural areas of Sierra Leone face a unique set of challenges that hinder the expansion of mobile networks and internet access. These challenges include low population density, low income levels, difficult terrain, lack of existing infrastructure, and limited access to the power grid. Due to these factors, remote and rural communities in Sierra Leone have experienced low digital penetration, making them less attractive for investment and the operation of connectivity networks. To address this issue, a potential solution could be the adoption of a collaborative approach between mobile network operators in Sierra Leone. By sharing resources and jointly procuring and deploying green energy-powered base stations equipped with computing capabilities, the operators can work towards enabling energy-efficient infrastructure sharing, including the base stations and their associated computing platforms. This resource management strategy, if implemented in the rural communication sites of Sierra Leone, could help to ensure a quality of service (QoS) that is comparable to that of the urban communication sites. By leveraging the shared infrastructure and resources, the mobile network operators can overcome the challenges posed by the rural landscape and work towards achieving universal access to the internet and improving overall connectivity in these underserved areas. The simulations conducted as part of the performance evaluation validate the analysis performed in this study. The results show that the prediction variations observed have a greater accuracy when comparing the harvested energy and the traffic load. This means the model is accurately capturing the relationship between the available renewable energy and the network's bandwidth requirements.
Additionally, the energy savings achieved by the proposed algorithm decrease as the number of mobile users connected to the remote site increases. In the specific case examined, with 50 users, the proposed algorithm was able to achieve 51% energy savings. This is a significant improvement over the 43% energy savings obtained by the benchmark algorithm used for comparison. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in optimizing energy usage and resource allocation, particularly in rural and remote areas with limited infrastructure and connectivity challenges.
